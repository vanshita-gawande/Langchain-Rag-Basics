# LangChain & RAG Basics

This repository contains my **hands-on practice and foundational experiments** with **LangChain** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** concepts using Python.

The purpose of this project is to **understand core building blocks of LangChain** by experimenting with different modules individually before building complete AI applications.
